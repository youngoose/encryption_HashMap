# Encryption JavaFX application using HashMap

* Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information from one form into another. The message is encrypted using an encryption algorithm. This turns the message into a cipher text. The person decoding the cipher text uses the encryption algorithm to decipher the message and make it readable.

* Example: Morse code is a very popular form of encoded message.  This changes words into a series of dots and dashes.  
	Regular Message: “Hello There”
	Morse code:”....   .   .-..   .-..   ---       -   ....   .   .-.   .”
  Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
  
* This JavaFX program has a key value pair using the cipher. It reads through the text field and creates the encrypted text according to the cipher.
